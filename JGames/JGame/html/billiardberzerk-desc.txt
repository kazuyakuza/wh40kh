A cross between billiards and Berzerk.  Destroy the robots using your billiard
ball, but do not let them touch your ball.  Kill robots using red balls or by
pushing them into walls.  Barrels will ignite when hit by fire or red balls.
Control using mouse or keyboard.   Use cursors to control; press shift to aim
a shot.  Or: drag mouse to aim a shot; hold mouse button without dragging to
control ball directly.
